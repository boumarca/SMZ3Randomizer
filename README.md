# SMZ3 Cas’ Randomizer

> “This is the cas'est version of the rando you’ll ever see.” \
>— Diabetus, 2021

The **SMZ3 Cas’ Randomizer** is a fork of the original [Super Metroid & A 
Link to the Past Crossover Randomizer](https://samus.link/). It’s aimed at making 
it a more approachable and casual experience by removing some decidedly 
_uncas’_ elements such as IBJ (Infinite Bomb Jump).

A Windows installer for latest version of the **SMZ3 Cas’ Randomizer** can be 
found on the [GitHub releases] page.

## Features
In addition to making IBJ completely optional, there is also:

 - Integrated voice-enabled item & location tracker;
 - Built-in MSU-1 support for custom music packs;
 - Item Quickswap in <cite>A Link to the Past</cite> based on a [contribution] 
   that never made it in;
 - More logic customization options;
 - Customizable ship sprites;
 - Sprites made by members of [Diabetus’](https://twitch.tv/the_betus) community and others;

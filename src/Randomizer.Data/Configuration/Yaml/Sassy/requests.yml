      High, on high I stand,
      Gazing down to see,
      The endless garden,
      Awaiting me.

      Red bloometh the rose of conviction,
      And red bloometh the rose of hate,
      Yes red bloometh the rose of contest,
      Firmly bound to its fate.

      And the war, it wageth on,
      The storm, it rageth on,
      The bold ever fight on,
      Their lives echoed in song.

      Fall, like snow they fall,
      Petals plucked and strewn,
      Yet from their seeds grow,
      This war anew.

      Blood trickling down from my fullers,
      And blood trickling down from mine hands,
      Yes, blood trickling down to Hydaelyn,
      Until I alone stand.

      The war, still wageth on,
      The storm, still rageth on,
      The bold blindly march on,
      Their lives, lost in a song.

      This was a triumph
      I'm making a note here; 'Huge success'
      It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
      Aperture Science
      We do what we must because we can
      For the good of all of us
      Except the ones who are dead
      But there's no sense crying over every mistake
      You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
      And the science gets done
      And you make a neat gun
      For the people who are still alive
      I'm not even angry
      I'm being so sincere right now
      Even though you broke my heart and killed me
      And tore me to pieces
      And threw every piece into a fire
      As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you
      Now, these points of data make a beautiful line
      And we're out of beta we're releasing on time
      So I'm GLaD I got burned
      Think of all the things we learned
      For the people who are still alive
      Go ahead and leave me
      I think I'd prefer to stay inside
      Maybe you'll find someone else to help you
      Maybe Black Mesa?
      That was a joke, Haha - Fat Chance
      Anyway this cake is great, it's so delicious and moist
      Look at me: still talking when there's science to do
      When I look out there, it makes me glad I'm not you
      I've experiments to run, there is research to be done
      On the people who are Still alive
      And believe me I am Still alive
      I'm doing science and I'm Still alive
      I feel fantastic and I'm Still alive
      While you're dying I'll be Still alive
      And when you're dead I will be Still alive
      Still alive

      The Unholy Moley
      Underworld bully
      I will crush those who oppose me
      Just like mummy told me
      My ambitions are cavernous
      My motto is avarice
      With loot I get so amorous
      For gold I am ravenous
      My manner is bombastic
      My statements, sarcastic
      My flow's pyroclastic
      My legend's dynastic
      When I rise like Lazarus
      My odor is always hazardous
      Your skill is at best average
      There's no way you can handle this
      Noticed your moves are atrocious
      So focus
      Hopeless
      Is what you are
      Now bow down to a true star
      Voice like thunder
      I leave the earth drawn asunder
      So don't make a blunder
      You'll be six feet under
      You better hide under covers I do what I wanna
      Did your feelings get hurt
      Step up girl you better stay alert
      Or you'll be nappin up in that dirt
      Fortissimole and I'm puttin in the work
      I hope you like this room
      Cause now it will be your tomb
      All your plans I will ruin
      If you don't play to my tune
      I thought you were gonna dig deep
      You sure didn't
      Must be kidding
      Now you can't make a peep
      Fortissimole in these streets
      Pause for the call
      From the windows to the walls
      See victory is not yours
      I came for the roars and applause
      And you are the main course
      Victory is mine

      It takes a lot to make a stew
      I couldn't face these streets without you
      A dash of crime to add some spice
      The city's like a pressure cooker turned up too high

      Some people say it'll spoil the broth
      But that's not the American way
      Too many cooks
      Too many cooks will serve a helping of freedom and resist the forces of evil

      It takes a lot to make a stew
      A pinch of salt and laughter too
      A scoop of kids to add the spice
      A dash of love to make it nice
      And you've got...

      Spooky scary skeletons send shivers down your spine
      Shrieking skulls will shock your soul, seal your doom tonight
      Spooky scary skeletons speak with such a screech
      You'll shake and shudder in surprise when you hear these zombies shriek

      We're so sorry skeletons, you're so misunderstood
      You only want to socialize (But I don't think we should)

      'Cause spooky scary skeletons shout startling shrilly screams
      They'll sneak from their sarcophagus and just won't leave you be

      Spirits supernatural are shy, what's all the fuss?
      But bags of bones seem so unsafe, it's semi-serious!

      Spooky scary skeletons are silly all the same
      They'll smile and scrabble slowly by and drive you so insane!
      Sticks and stones will break your bones, they seldom let you snooze
      Spooky scary skeletons will wake you with a boo!

      To the town of Agua Fria
      Rode a stranger one fine day
      Hardly spoke to folks around him
      Didn't have too much to say
      No one dared to ask his business
      No one dared to make a slip
      The stranger there among them
      Had a big iron on his hip
      Big iron on his hip

      It was early in the morning
      When he rode into the town
      He came riding from the south side
      Slowly looking all around
      He's an outlaw loose and running
      Came the whisper from each lip
      And he's here to do some business
      With the big iron on his hip
      Big iron on his hip

      In this town there lived an outlaw
      By the name of Texas Red
      Many men had tried to take him
      And that many men were dead
      He was vicious and a killer
      Though a youth of twenty-four
      And the notches on his pistol
      Numbered one and nineteen more
      One and nineteen more

      Now the stranger started talking
      Made it plain to folks around
      Was an Arizona Ranger
      Wouldn't be too long in town
      He came here to take an outlaw
      Back alive, or maybe dead
      And he said it didn't matter
      He was after Texas Red
      After Texas Red

      Wasn't long before the story
      Was relayed to Texas Red
      But the outlaw didn't worry
      Men that tried before were dead
      Twenty men had tried to take him
      Twenty men had made a slip
      Twenty-one would be the Ranger
      With the big iron on his hip
      Big iron on his hip

      The morning passed so quickly
      It was time for them to meet
      It was twenty past eleven
      When they walked out in the street
      Folks were watching from the windows
      Everybody held their breath
      They knew this handsome Ranger
      Was about to meet his death
      'Bout to meet his death

      There was forty feet between them
      When they stopped to make their play
      And the swiftness of the Ranger
      Is still talked about today
      Texas Red had not cleared leather
      'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
      And the Ranger's aim was deadly
      With the big iron on his hip
      Big iron on his hip

      It was over in a moment
      And the folks had gathered round
      There before them lay the body
      Of the outlaw on the ground
      Oh, he might have went on livin'
      But he made one fatal slip
      When he tried to match the Ranger
      With the big iron on his hip
      Big iron on his hip

      Big iron, big iron
      When he tried to match the Ranger
      With the big iron on his hip
      Big iron on his hip

      Penny for your thoughts.

      I hate Brenda, and a bad guy hit me in the shin, and I peed on all my pants

      It's nothing a little music can't help.

      Rockin'
      Rockin' and rollin'
      Down to the beach I'm strolling
      But the seagulls poke at my head
      Not fun!
      I said 'Seagulls... mmgh! Stop it now!'
      Everyone told me
      Not to stroll on that beach
      Said seagulls gonna come
      Poke me in the coconut
      And they did
      And they did
      Had me goin' like
      Nothing I could do but yell
      When these birds attacked me
      When I tried to run I fell
      And then these kids start laughing
      And then
      Got hit in the neck with a hacky sack
      Where'd it come from?
      Now run, run, run, jump!
      I can be a backpack while you run
      Run, run, run, jump!
      And stop
      Put me down
      I love to groove and boogie
      Yeah

      Great

      Show you some dance moves

      No, I don't want you to

      If I had your giant feet
      Out there on the beach
      Could have outrun those birds

      You're a psycho wiener!

      Let me grab my beater

      Stop it please!

      Don't hit me
      Please
      Don't hit me

      Come on man! Quit that banging

      Hey, what's that stank?

      You put a fish in our basket!

      Oh, yeah!
      I forgot I did that

      You owe me an apology

      Just hold your breath and see
      When the time is right
      Birds'll bite your face
      Now run, run, run, jump!
      I can be a backpack while you run
      Swing from a hairy vine
      I can be your backpack while you climb
      Stand on one hand and lift
      Rocks with your special gift
      Run, run, run, jump!
      Now breathe
      That's good
      Like that
      Like that
      One day I was walking and I found this big log
      Then I rolled the log over
      And underneath was a tiny little stick
      And I was like, 'That log had a child!'
      Listen, boy
      Someday when you are older
      You could get hit by a boulder
      While you're lying there
      Screaming, 'Come help me please!'
      The seagulls poke your knees
      Stop it now!

      Whatever, you're sorta pitchy

      Didn't like it?

      Listen, man, I'm not your friend

      Don't fall asleep
      Don't fall asleep

      Are you, uh, a real villain?
      Well, uh, technically... nah.
      Have you ever caught a good guy, like, uh, like a real superhero?
      Nah.

      We are Number One
      Hey!
      We are Number One

      Ha ha ha
      Now look at this net, that I just found
      When I say go, be ready to throw
      Go!
      (Throw it at him, not me!)
      (Ugh, let's try something else)
      Now watch and learn, here's the deal
      He'll slip and slide on this banana peel!
      (Ha ha ha! What are you doing!?)

      Out of the corner of your eye, you spot him. (Shy-ah LaBuff)
      He's following you, about 30 feet back
      He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint
      He's gaining on you! (Shy-ah LaBuff)
      You're looking for your car, but you're all turned around
      He's almost upon you now, and you can see there's blood on his face!
      My god, there's blood everywhere!

      Running for your life from Shy-ah LaBuff
      He's brandishing a knife, it's Shy-ah LaBuff
      Lurking in the shadows, hollywood superstar Shy-ah LaBuff
      Living in the woods, Shia LeBeouf
      Killing for sport, Shy-ah LaBuff
      Eating all the bodies, actual cannibal Shy-ah LaBuff

      Now it's dark, and you seem to have lost him
      But you're hopelessly lost yourself, stranded with a murderer
      You creep silently through the underbrush
      Aha! In the distance, a small cottage with a light on!
      Hope!
      You move stealthily toward it, but your leg! Ah! It's caught in a bear trap!

      Gnawing off your leg (Quiet, quiet)
      Limping toward the cottage (Quiet, quiet)
      Now you're on the doorstep
      Sitting inside, Shy-ah LaBuff
      Sharpening an ax, Shy-ah LaBuff
      But he doesn't hear you enter, Shy-ah LaBuff
      You're sneaking up behind him
      Strangling superstar Shy-ah LaBuff
      Fighting for your life with Shy-ah LaBuff
      Wrestling a knife from Shy-ah LaBuff
      Stab it in his kidney
      Safe at last from Shy-ah LaBuff

      You limp into the dark woods, blood oozing from your stump leg
      You've beaten Shy-ah LaBuff
      Wait! He isn't dead! Shia Surprise!
      There's a gun to your head, and death in his eyes
      But you can do Jiu Jitsu
      Body Slam superstar Shy-ah LaBuff
      Legendary fight with Shy-ah LaBuff
      Normal Tuesday night for Shy-ah LaBuff
      You try to swing an axe at Shy-ah LaBuff
      But blood is draining fast from your stump leg
      He's dodging every swipe, he parries to the left
      You counter to the right, you catch him in the neck
      You're chopping off his head now
      You have just decapitated Shy-ah LaBuff

      His head topples to the floor, expressionless
      You fall to your knees and catch your breath
      You're finally safe from Shy-ah LaBuff

      Play the guitar, play it again, my Johnny
      Maybe you're cold but you're so warm inside
      I was always a fool for my Johnny
      For the one they call Johnny Guitar
      Play it again, Johnny Guitar

      What if you go, what if you stay, I love you

      For whom weeps the storm,
      Her tears on our skin
      The days of our years gone,
      Our souls soaked in sin
      These memories ache with the weight of tomorrow

      Who fights?
      Who flies?
      Who falls?

      One brings shadow, one brings light
      Two-toned echoes tumbling through time
      Threescore wasted, ten cast aside
      Four-fold knowing, no end in sight
      One brings shadow, one brings light
      One dark future no one survives
      On their shadows, away we fly

      The road that we walk
      Is lost in the flood
      Here proud angels bathe in
      Their wages of blood
      At this, the world's end, do we cast off tomorrow

      One brings shadow, one brings light
      To this riddle all souls are tied
      Brief our moments, brazen and bright
      Forged in fury, tempered in ice
      Hindmost devils, early to rise
      Sing come twilight, sleep when they die
      Heaven's banquet leavened with lies
      Sating honor, envy, and pride
      One brings shadow, one brings light
      Run from the light

      Authors of our fates
      Orchestrate our fall from grace
      Poorest players on the stage
      Our defiance drives us straight to the edge
      A reflection in the glass
      Recollections of our past
      Swift as darkness, cold as ash
      Far beyond this dream of paradise lost

      Home
      Riding home
      Dying hope
      Hold onto hope... Ohhh...
      Home
      Riding home
      Home, riding home
      Hope, finding hope... Ohhh...

      One brings shadow, one brings light
      One more chapter we've yet to write
      Want for nothing, nothing denied
      Wand'ring ended, futures aligned
      One brings shadow, one brings light
      One brings shadow, one brings light
      You are the light

      We fall
      We fall
      We fall
      We fall unto the end

      One world's end

      Our world's end

      Our end

      We won't end

      I am shadow, I am the light

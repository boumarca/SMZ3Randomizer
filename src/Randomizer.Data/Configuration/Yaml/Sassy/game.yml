    So how many red
    rupees did you find
    this time?
- Text: |-
    Huh. Apparently
    you don't take
    fall damage...
    but perhaps we 
    can retest that!
- Text: |-
    I'm actually
    extremely weak 
    to the Spazer.
    If only you knew
    how to use it.

    Just wait until I
    start hiding items
    in every pot AND
    every breakable
    block in Metroid!
- Text: |-
    I don't even like
    Mother Brain. I
    asked to be teamed
    up with King K.
    Rool this time,
    but no...

    Now that Hyrule
    and Zebes have
    completed the
    corporate merger,
    I can't wait until
    we're the next
    company bought
    out by Disney.

    Again? Next time
    I'm putting Morph
    in my tile room.

    Now that loot boxes
    are out of fashion,
    next time you can
    get all the items
    by buying the 5000
    rupee battle pass!

    Did you hear what
    Shaktool said about
    Metroid Dread?

    He really digs it.

    Before we start
    this battle, I'd
    like to thank the
    sponsor of this
    seed, RidleyCons!
    I actually bought
    a pair and love
    them! Now on to
    the boss fight!
- Text: |-
    I heard that Ridley
    tried to setup a 
    carnival.

    It didn't Norfair
    very well.

    I'm actually the
    boss?! Top 10
    anime betrayals!
- Text: |-
    What do the shrimp
    babies say when
    you beat the boss
    of Maridia?

    If only I had 
    a gondola

    They could call me
    Venetian Blind!
- Text: |-
    Light?! I don't
    need this!

    Couldn't you go
    break Mothula's
    roof instead?

    Have you played
    the hit new table-
    top RPG, Dungeons
    and Draygons? It's
    a lot of fun!
- Text: |-
    Instead of this
    boss battle, why
    don't we watch my 
    favorite movie The
    Phantoon Menace?

    Wow, you did Ganon
    last? How unfortu-
    nate.
- Text: |-
    Just for full dis-
    closure, Zebes
    exploded while you
    slayed Ganon. The
    animals were NOT
    saved.

    1st try!

    Sorry, it's too
    late to wish for
    a better seed.
- Text: |-
    Don't worry, I'm
    sure that Shaktool
    made it off Zebes.
- Text: |-
    Oh... you actually
    did it? You beat
    the game? Wow.

      When the shadow of doubt has grown
      And your heart has turned to stone
      You're alone, trapped
      In a cage of emotion
      Why does it have to be like this
      Why do we talk when we could kiss
      My heart's an abyss
      And I'm all out of lotion

      Why can't we be more than friends
      Why can't you see

      That baby I'm in the zone
      Like a king without a throne
      I'd rather have you by my side
      Than play the skin trombone
      I thought that what we had was real
      But I couldn't close the deal
      I'm a piece of shit, cause baby
      Baby I'm in the Zone

      Now every time I see your face
      It puts me back right in that place
      On my own, lost
      In the arena of sorrows
      You say you care then cut me loose
      You know the truth there's no excuse
      This is total abuse and I just
      Bought some lotion

      Why can't we be more than friends
      Why can't you see

      That baby I'm in the zone
      And the future's still unknown
      I'm starting to think clearly now
      That I've had some time alone
      I thought that what we had was real
      But I couldn't close the deal
      I totally suck at this
      Yeah baby, cause baby

      I'm in the zone
      Cause baby
      Baby I'm in the Zone

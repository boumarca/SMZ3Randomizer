# game rather than as respnses from Tracker.

# Note that lines of text in ALttP have a maximum of 19 characters.
# If you include text as one long line, it'll automatically wrap the
# text for you, but you can also do something like the following if
# you would like it to manage it yourself for effect. However, the
# first line cannot be blank.

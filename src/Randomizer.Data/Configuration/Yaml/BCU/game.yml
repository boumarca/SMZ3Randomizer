    Zelda has dedi-
    cated 1 billion
    rupees to giving
    Hyrule free dark
    world access
    through portals,
    so soon even in
    the Tower of Hera
    they will have our
    refurbished moon
    pearls. All of us
    need funding for a
    Triforce. The Tri-
    force, will be the
    most popular Tri-
    force in history.
    It's existence is
    inevitable, and
    the public needs
    it.

    Just so you know,
    we had a retreat
    before this seed,
    and I was paired
    up with Kraid's
    Awful Son for the
    trust exercises.
    I'm ready to die.

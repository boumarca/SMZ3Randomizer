# This config file is used for additional item information

# Fields

# Item: The identifier for the item that is used to combine possibilities between configs.
# Name: The list of possibilities for the name of the item
# Multiple: Set to true if this is a custom item where you can track it multiple times
# Plural: The list of possibilities for the name of the item when there are more than one
# WhenTracked: This is a list of amounts and the possibilities of tracker responses for
#     if the player has that many of the item. For example, you can have a list of
#     possibilities for when the player has picked up the first one, when they have picked
#     up their fifth one, etc. If the number isn't listed, then it will fall back to the
#     last number listed. For example, if you have responses for 1 and 5 and the player
#     has picked up their third one, it will use the response for 1. Putting in a blank
#     response will have tracker use the default message for tracking the item.
# Stages: For progressive items such as swords and shields, this allows you to give
#     different names for each stage. For example, for swords stage 1 can be the fighter's
#     sword and stage 2 can be master sword.
# Hints: The list of possibilities for vague descriptors of the item for the hint system
